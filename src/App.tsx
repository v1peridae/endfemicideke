          Kenya has been facing an ongoing femicide and increased gender based violence. As I write this, I feel worried. Worried about what
          if it's someone else tomorrow? What if it's me tomorrow? In all honesty, I'm scared.

              be in a group of people if you are going somewhere for the first time. If you are a minor, make sure you are with an adult you

            What is the role of men in this conversation?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold font-Quattrocento text-center px-4 md:px-20">
            Femicide is defined as "the killing of a woman or girl, in particular by a man and on account of her gender." In all these cases
            there has been a reccuring pattern, men are the perpetrators and most of the times the enablers. We unfortunately live in a
            country where the systems in place do not work and sometimes dont even exist to protect women. For example, in Argentina there
            is the Micaela Law, in Turkey there Law No. 6284 and some Latin American countries have specific legistation towards femicide.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold font-Quattrocento text-center px-4 md:px-20 mt-10">
            While there are some laws aimed at protecting women, their implementation is often inadequate, and they do not specifically
            categorise femicide as a distinct crime and the government fails to acknowledge the unique nature of gender-based killings and
            the different kinds of violences.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold font-Quattrocento text-center px-4 md:px-20 mt-10">
            We need men to be allies in this conversation and to be part of the solution. As seen on social media many men still joke about
            and promote killing women for instance "Albert Serem" who on the 10th of December 2024 added a note to his Instagram that said
            "kill them all." as a reaction to the protests against femicide and when confronted had absolutely no remorse. Stuff like this
            builds a culture of violence and disrespect towards women. Such people are the ones who are the enablers of femicide and
            violence against women. We need to hold them accountable. If you are a man, be an ally. If you see a woman in danger, help her.
            If you see a woman being harassed, stop it, you have the power to stop it. This system is built to work for you so use it to
            protect women.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold font-Quattrocento text-center px-4 md:px-20 mt-10">
            We need to stop only justifying the stop because of relation to women. A woman should not have to be your sister to matter, a
            woman should not have to be your wife to matter, a woman should not have to be your daughter to matter. A woman should matter
            because she is a human being.

          <p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold font-Quattrocento text-center px-4 md:px-20 mt-10">
            Online there has been such a huge culture of bashing victims of femicide. On X theyre even worse than on platforms like TikTok.
            I have seen people defend the murders by saying stuff like "Why did she go?" "She deserves it for being a gold digger". We need
            to stop this culture of blaming the victims. We need to stop blaming the victims. We need to stop blaming the victims and listen
            to survivors.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold font-Quattrocento text-center px-4 md:px-20 mt-10">
            A quote I think about alot is "Educate Your Sons". And we need to do exactly that. We need to educate the next generation to be
            better men and promote positive masculinity. You don't just wake up one day with the hatred in you to decide to kill someone.
            Hatred is learned.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold font-Quattrocento text-center px-4 md:px-20 mt-10">
            We need to also promote conversations about GBV and femicide. Talk about the warning signs and the effects with everyone not
            just women. Conversations like these give perspective to people who would otherwise not be educated and also help them
            understand the severity of this.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold font-Quattrocento text-center px-4 md:px-20 mt-10 mb-0">
            BOYCOTT. Boycott organisations and people who have the power to make change but ignore the issue. Boycott people and
            organisations supporting police violence. Boycott perpetrators and enablers. Leaving these people and organisations without
            support or a platform will force them to change.
